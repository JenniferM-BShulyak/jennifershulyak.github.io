					<h2>My Story		
					</h2>
					<p>After five years in education, I began the Data Analytics and Visualizations Boot Camp at the University of Texas at Austin so that I could follow my old and new passions of learning and coding through a career in data analytics. 
						As a high school math educator I was devoted to improving the quality of curriculum and instruction using data. The COVID pandemic only emphasized the importance of quality online math curriculum instruction and resources, which led me to nurture my growing interest in coding and data science. 
						I taught myself how to create interactive Desmos websites using its Computation Layer, to curate my teaching website with HTML and CSS, and eventually to learn Javascript and Python all without little to no direction. 
						These experiences ignited a desire to learn more about data science and to pursue a new career.
					</p>
					<p>During the UT Bootcamp, I learned a variety of news skills and strengthed others while getting to bring in different aspects my teaching background such as having to investigate different situations (students and how they learned, their base knowledge, etc.) in order to differentiate instruction (determine the best mode of translation and presentation). 
						Through activities and projects, I discovered that one of my favorite elements of data analytics is creating and refining ETL pipelines as you get to clean, explore, and transform data in order to unravel its secrets and automate processes.
						 
						I'm excited to put my new skills to work helping companies optimize their workflows by processing, exploring, and presenting their data.

									<h2><a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jennifer.shulyak/viz/Zillow_Austin_Zipcodes/Dashboard1">The Austin Housing Market: Python, Javascript, Tableau<br />
									</a></h2>
								</header>
								
								<p>In this project, I worked as part of a team to build a temporary webpage with interactive visualizations and tables. 
									My roles were to extract and trasform the data as well as to create the line plots looking at the zestimate data over time in Plotly. I worked closely with other team members to build the JS endpoints and connect with the PostegreSQ database using SQLAlchemy.</p>
								<p>I later decided to extend the project by created a Tableau Dashboard to better summarize trends and compare capabilities with Plotly. I would present the analysis to potential homebuyers and/or future Austinites with the Tableau Dashboard.
									The Tableau Dashboard includes interactivity so the user can click on a zipcode to look at its key performance metrics. The dashboard is also color coded to make it clear in which region of Austin a zipcode is.
								</p>

									<li><a href="https://github.com/JenniferM-BShulyak/zillow_austin_housing_market" class="button large">View Project</a></li>
								</ul>
								<p>Some Key Findings:
									<ul>
										1. All zipcodes experienced similar changes over time. However, during a period of steady home value increase between 2012 and 2016, there was more variability between the zipcodes where East and South East Austin Zipcodes experienced higher month to month increases staying between +1.5-2%. 
										During this time, the other zipcodes maintained monthly increases closer to +0.5-1.0%.
					
									
										<ul>
										2. East and SouthEast Austin experienced the largest percentage change in price in the last 10 years, over 200% increase in average prices. SouthWest Austin experienced the lowest percent change: 91%.
										Regions East of 135 have historically had significant Black and Hispanic minorities. It is notable that these regions also had the largest jumps in home values.
									</ul> 
									<u>3. Monthly zestimate changes in Austin became more volatile at the onset of the COVID epidemic. 
										Before the pandemic, investing in several Austin Zipcodes look promising, but investing now could be risky as the housing market has yet to stablize.

										<h2><a href="#">Crowdfunding ETL and Data Exploration using Python and SQL</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/crowdfunding.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Before starting or investing in a crowdfunding campaign for start ups, it is important to know what makes a successful campaign!
										This project looked to what kind of campaigns were successful and to look at the metrics around repeat campaigns.
										I would make a summary page of the query results to show potential investors or entrepeneurs looking to start a campaign to aid in the decision process.
										I would ask that the client make request on other queries they would like performed on the data. 
									</p>

									</ul>

									<p>Some Key Findings:
										<ul>
											1. Journalism and technology campaigns were the most successful, while gaming campaigns were the lesat successful with less than half proving to be successful.
										</ul>
										<ul>
											2. There did not appear to be scammers: No individuals were starting multiple campaigns under multiple companies.
										</ul> 
										<ul>
											3. Overall success rate ranged between 50-58% with the least successful campaigns being based in the Canada and the most successful campaigns being based in Britain.

									</header>
									<a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jennifer.shulyak/viz/CrashCourseAnalysis/Story1?publish=yes" class="image fit"><img src="images/CC_Logo.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Crash Course is a YouTube Channel devoted to providing free and accessible education to students everywhere, but it is still a business. 
										This project aimed to look for trends in the channel statistics and determine what decisions the company can make to get them more of those money-making views. 
										I would present the findings to Crash Course through a Tableau Story with interactive dashboards and ultimately talk about recommendations on course decisions to make in the future.

									</ul>
									<p> Some Key Findings:
										<ul>
											1. The most popular genre of courses are history, social sciences, Enlish, and the social sciences.
											The least popular genre is film. I would recommend Crash Course invest more resources towards history courses.    
										</ul>
										<ul>
											2.  The view count drops and the duration of each epsiode rises over the course of a season regardless of genre.
											However, there is not a correlation between duration and view count or like count. 
											It may be worthwhile then to focus on producing more courses with shorter seasons.

									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/NLP.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Are cryptocurrencies an attractive investment given current economic indicators and sentiment? To answer this question, 
										data was extracted from multiple sources and transformed in Python. The machine learning models were built to analyze sentiment and forecast market performance.
										In order to present this analysis to clients, I would provide them with Tableau Dashboards displaying the results.

									</ul>
									<p> Some Key Findings:
										<ul>
											1. Bitcoin sentiment fluctuates with world events and there is some correlation with Bitcoin news sentiment and it market performance. 
											However, sentiment analyis failed to provide predictive power when used as a variable for forecasting.   
										</ul>
										<ul>
											2.  Vader more accurately predicted what the team identified as being positive headlines while the Random Forest NLP labeled them as neutral. Accuracy for both models varies wildly: 40-80%.
											Natural Language Processing Tools need to be be more finely tuned and trained on more robust and related data.

									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/adidas.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p> As times change and the world moves to be more online, companies like Adidas need to pay close attention to customer behavior. 
										This project aims to identify key performance indicators for Adidas merchandise in order to make suggestions on areas of potential in order to bolster sales.
										This analysis would be presented to managers via interactive MS Excel Dashboards where managers can filter through the data by the "gender" of the item, the region of sale, and the retailer.   
									</p>
									<ul class="actions special">
										<li><a href="https://github.com/JenniferM-BShulyak/adidas_BI" class="button">View Project</a></li>
									</ul>
									<p> Some Key Findings:
										<ul>
											1. Apparel items geared toward females are far more popular than those geared toward men regardless of sale-method; this correlates with a higher price per unit for female aparrel items as well. 
											This demonstrates that raising the price of female oriented goods does not equate to lower sales.     
										</ul>
										<ul>
											2. There is a 46.71% drop in outlet units sold in the Summer 2021 during the months of June and July. A significant drop was present in both years of data provided. 
											It may be worth investing in marketing towards students out for the summer or ensuring inventory is not sitting and to avoid inventory obsolescence.

										<h2><a href="#">Excel Project Looking at Job Rating and Salary Breakdown</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/excel.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p> Employee happiness is important for retention and productivity. 
										In this project, I examined employee happiness and how salaries reflected the number of years an employee was at the company.
										I would show the managers at the company the excel dashboard where they can sort employees by their employement status and department.
										Managers can test out different progressive raises based on an employee's time at the company and how it effects the company's profit margin. 
									</p>
									<ul class="actions special">
										<li><a href="" class="button">View Project</a></li>
									</ul>
									<p> Some Key Findings:
										<ul>
											1. Salaries do not reflect employee's number of years at the company regardless of deparment or employment status.
											Managers may consider rewarding employees based on their number of years at the company as the overall job rating at the company is below 3.5/5.    
										</ul>
										<ul>
											2.  Managers should survey the Environmental Compliance Department to discuss complaints as this deparment has the lowest job rating overall.
											This department also has the overall lowest average salary which could play a part in job satisfaction.
