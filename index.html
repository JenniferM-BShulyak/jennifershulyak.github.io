					<h2>My Story		
					</h2>
					<p>After five years in education, I began the Data Analytics and Visualizations Boot Camp at the University of Texas at Austin so that I could follow my old and new passions of learning and coding through a career in data analytics. As a high school math educator I was devoted to improving the quality of curriculum and instruction using data, whether it be data I had collected myself or based on expert research. The COVID pandemic only emphasized the importance of quality online math curriculum instruction and resources, which led me to nurture my growing interest in coding and data science. I taught myself how to create interactive Desmos websites using its Computation Layer, to curate my teaching website with HTML and CSS, and eventually to learn Javascript and Python all without little or no direction. These experiences ignited a desire to learn more about data science and to pursue a new career.

									<h2><a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jennifer.shulyak/viz/Zillow_Austin_Zipcodes/Dashboard1">The Austin Housing Market: Python, Javascript, Tableau<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>In this project, I worked with a team to extract Zillow zestimate (estimated listing) and rental data for the Austin metro. 
										We worked to build a temporary webpage with interactive visualization and tables using Javascript, HTML, and Plotly. Data was cleaned and transformed in Python and stored in a PostegreSQL database. 
										My roles were to extract and trasform the data as well as to create the line plots looking at the zestimate data over time in Plotly. I worked closely with other team members to build the JS endpoints and connect with the PostegreSQ database using SQLAlchemy.</p>
									<p>I later decided to extend the project by created a Tableau Dashboard to better summarize trends and compare capabilities with Plotly. </p>

										<h2><a href="#">Crowdfunding ETL and Data Exploration using Python and SQL</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/crowdfunding.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Before starting or investing in a crowdfunding campaign for start ups, it is important to know what makes a successful campaign!
										I would make a summary page of the query results for potential investors or entrepeneurs looking to start a campaign to aid in the decision process.
									</p>

									</ul>

									<p>Some Key Findings:
										<ul>
											1. Journalism and technology campaigns were the most successful, while gaming campaigns were the lesat successful with less than half proving to be successful.
										</ul>
										<ul>
											2. There did not appear to be scammers: No individuals were starting multiple campaigns under multiple companies.
										</ul>

									<p>Skills/tools used: Python, Pandas, PostgresSQL, PGAdmin4, QuickDBD (to build Entity Relationship Diagram)</p>

									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/NLP.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Are cryptocurrencies an attractive investment given current economic indicators and sentiment? To answer this question, 
										data was extracted from multiple sources and transformed in Python. The machine learning models were built to analyze sentiment and forecast market performance.
										In order to present this analysis to clients, I would provide them with Tableau Dashboards displaying the results.

									</ul>
									<p> Some Key Findings:
										<ul>
											1. Bitcoin sentiment fluctuates with world events and there is some correlation with Bitcoin news sentiment and it market performance.   
										</ul>
										<ul>
											2.  Vader more accurately predicted what the team identified as being positive headlines while the Random Forest NLP labeled them as neutral. Accuracy for both models varies wildly: 40-80%.
										</ul>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/food.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project aimed to see how reliable ratings are from the general public and food trends over time. Python was used to extract and transform the data. Regex was used to identify trendy ingredients. Discovered that you really can't rely on public ratings!</p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/SharkDashboard.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this project, I extracted messy shark encounter data via an open API and then cleaned it in Python.
										The cleaned dataset was then analyzed by making a dashboard in Tableau that looked at key metrics such as shark species.
